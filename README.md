Being a big football fan, I wanted to develop a small script that could allow me to simulate matches.

I used python and machine learning for that. Depending on the teams that play each other, the coach, the tactics and the market value of the players in the starting XI, all based on the Euro and Copa America 2020, this script will generate the possible stats of a match.
